# Toys

Most modules can be built from deconstructed toys and other common items. 
Thrift shops, garage sales and other recycling centers are great places to track down
broken toys that will be brought back to life as modules.

By harvesting the electronic components from toys, we also provide a context
in which those components are being used "for real".

> Opening and deconstructing a toy will mostly likely void any kind of warranty.
