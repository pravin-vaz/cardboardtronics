# Switch

Switches select between a closed or open circuit. Of course, there's many different switches you will find when opening electronic components.

* Take a deep dive and read the [SparkFun's switch basics guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/switch-basics).

A simple switch has 2 terminals, called **pole** and **throw**.
If we are lucky, the switch terminals are soldered to cables
and we can use the cable-binder connecting to connect them into a
module.

Toggle switches have terminals with mounted screws. 
We can either thread recycled cables or use paper clips to connect them to the binder clips.
