# Battery packs

When opening toys, we will often end up with a nice AA or AAA battery holder with two terminals. 
Because batteries may heat up a lot when shorted, a _reversible fuse_ should be added to the module.

It is likely that the kids will create shorted circuits. A shorted battery may be damage, heat up or even explode.
**For those reasons, it is very important to add a _reversible fuse_ to any battery pack.**

To create a fuse, you will need to find ``0.5A`` or ``1A`` ``Resettable Fuse Radial Lead PPTC Polyswitch``. 
When the circuit is shorted, the high current heats up the fuse which eventually trips. Let it cool down and your battery pack will be operational again. Because the fuse gets hot, it's important to add some heat shielding around it to avoid burns.

* using a paper connector, connect the positive cable to one end of the fuse. Connect the other end of the fuse to a binder clip.

* Add add a protective layer of cardboard above the fuse to
prevent burns.
