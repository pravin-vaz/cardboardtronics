# micro:bit Tone Amplifier

![micro:bit as speaker amplifier](/assets/modules/controller/microbit/relay/speakercircuit.jpg)

The **micro:bit** music blocks control the pin ``P0``. This current from this pin needs to be amplified in order to play in large speakers. Fortunately, the micro:bit produces very basic sounds (square sound waves) that can be amplified with a single transistor.

This module is built like the [relay](/modules/controller/microbit/relay).

## Code

The code below plays a "power up" melody when button **A** is pressed and "power down" when button **B** is pressed. The speaker should be connected
to the MOSFET connected to the pin ``P0``.
