# LED

A LED is Light Emitting Diode. It's a piece of electronics that contains 
a crystal that generates light under a current. Watch out, it only allows current to flow one way and blocks it the other way. An LED can be easily destroyed by high currents so it is recommended to mount it in series with a 200Ω (Ohm) resistor.

or watch [Adabot from Adafruit](https://youtu.be/E2WcaJySVuw).

The 200Ω resitors has 2 red lines and 1 black line. You can find tons of apps online that will help you compute this value based on the colors.

* Connect the ground terminal (-), the short one, to a binder clip.
* Connect the positive terminal (+), the long one, to a paper fasterner
together with a terminal of the resistor
* Clamp the remaining resitor terminal to a binder clip
