# Cable to paper clip connector

Somewhat a bit more elusive than the binder clip, it is also possible to squeeze the cable on a paper clip on the side of the board. 

## Make

## Step 1: Slide over the paper clip

While holding the cable, slide the paper clip on the side of the board. Carefully ensure that the paper clip is squeezing the metal end of the cable to get a good connection.

## Step 2: gluing!

The paper clip tends to slide away from the cardboard. With this connector, it is more convinient to glue it immediately.
