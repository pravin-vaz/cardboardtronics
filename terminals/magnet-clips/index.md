* Position the cardboard box on top of the cable and magnets. If needed, cut out a small opening for the cable.

* Fill mold with hot glue and let the glue cool down (seriously, wait...). Once the glue has settled, unstick from the sheet - it's ready

* Extra points: add more cardboard around the cable to ensure that it would be ripped away.
