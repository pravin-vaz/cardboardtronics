Just like **[Tinkering Studio circuit boards](https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/tinkering/files/Instructions/circuit_boards.pdf)**,
cardboard circuits should be exploratory in nature and drive by the interrest of the tinkerer. We provide a few inspiring projects to get their inspiration going. Encourage your users to come up with their own!

> **Educators:** Read the [Educator Addendum](https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/tinkering/files/Instructions/circuit_boards.pdf) on tips to setup your environment and facilitate sessions.
