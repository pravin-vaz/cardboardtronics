# Tools

This page provides an overview of tools that you will (eventually) need to build your modules.

* **Make sure to always read the safety notice of each individual tool.**

## Philips screwdriver

To open a toy, you will have to unscrew a large number of Philips screws. Students should have access to a wide range of screw driver sizes. Keep a toolbox with a range of screwdrivers handy. Also reuse any screws that come out of the toys. 

## Wire cutter / Snippers
* **Tip** Remind participants when using snippers to watch out for flying metal bits.You could provide some eye protection when using snippers and have it away from general workspace (maybe closer to the soldering station ).

## Wire trimmer

## Cardboard scissors

Cardboard can be challenging to cut with regular scissors. Box cutters are great but are a health and safety risk! DO NOT LEAVE THEM UNATTENDED. 

## Glue gun

An absolute must in the Maker toolbelt is the glue gun. 

* **Tip** Purchasing glue sticks in bulk is MUCH cheaper than per small individual packs.

## Soldering Iron

* **Tip** 1 soldering station per classroom is typically enough for a start. Just ensure you have your health and safety in place. For example: training for proper use or possibly manning one person close to the soldering station, using Lead free solder and having an exhaust fan for fumes and finally, directing students what to do incase of a burn.
